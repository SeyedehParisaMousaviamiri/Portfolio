                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project is a website celebrating Persian cultural events, particularly the "Persian Night" or "Yalda Night" ceremony. It serves as an informative platform, detailing significant Persian traditions and festivals such as Yalda Night, Chaharshanbe Suri (Fire Festival), Nowruz (Persian New Year), and Sizdeh Bedar (Outdoor Day). The webpage features a navigation menu linking to sections like Home, About, Events, and Contact, along with comprehensive descriptions of each event's cultural significance, date, and location. Additionally, it includes a contact form for event registration, visually engaging images, and a footer with contact information, a Google Map embed, and social media links. Overall, the project aims to promote understanding and appreciation of Persian culture while encouraging community participation in traditional celebrations.</p>
                <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> HTML, CSS</p>
                <p><strong>Your Role:</strong> Developed the front-end components and implemented responsive design.</p>
                <p><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong>  I faced several challenges, including effectively organizing and presenting a wealth of information about Persian cultural events in a way that would engage users while maintaining clarity. To address this, I structured the content into clearly defined sections, ensuring each event had its own dedicated area with concise descriptions and relevant details. Another challenge was ensuring the website was visually appealing and user-friendly; I resolved this by selecting appropriate images and designing a straightforward navigation menu that enhances user experience. Additionally, I encountered issues with ensuring the contact form functioned correctly for event registration; I tackled this by thoroughly testing the form's submission process and implementing necessary adjustments to ensure it collected information seamlessly. Overall, these challenges allowed me to enhance my problem-solving skills and develop a more cohesive and inviting website.</p>
                <p><strong>Results:</strong> I am pleased to accept Hack Your Future as a pivotal experience that has significantly contributed to my personal and professional growth.</p>

                <h3>Survey Form</h3>
                <p><strong>Overview:</strong> This project implements a Dating Questionnaire form that collects essential client information for matchmaking services. It includes fields for personal details such as name, age, marital status, preferences, hobbies, and a brief self-description. The form uses various input types for ease of use, organized within fieldsets for clarity. Required fields are clearly indicated, and it is designed to submit data to a demo URL. Overall, it provides a user-friendly interface for potential clients to share their information.</p>
        <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> HTML, CSS</p>
        <p><strong>Your Role:</strong> In this project, my role involved designing and developing the HTML document that serves as the foundation for the website celebrating Persian cultural events, particularly the "Persian Night" or "Yalda Night" ceremony. I was responsible for structuring the content to ensure clarity and accessibility, including detailed descriptions of various Persian traditions and festivals. Additionally, I created the navigation menu for easy user access to different sections, integrated a contact form for event registration, and selected relevant images to enhance visual engagement. I also focused on ensuring the overall aesthetic and functionality of the webpage, contributing to a user-friendly experience that promotes the appreciation of Persian culture and encourages community participation in the celebrations.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges & Solutions:</strong> During the development of the Dating Questionnaire, one of the main challenges was ensuring the form was both user-friendly and visually appealing. Balancing accessibility with aesthetic design required careful consideration of layout and spacing. To address this, I conducted user testing and gathered feedback to identify areas for improvement. Additionally, implementing input validation posed another challenge, as it was essential to ensure accurate data collection without frustrating users. I solved this by using HTML5 validation features and providing clear error messages, guiding users to correct any mistakes while maintaining a smooth submission process.</p>
